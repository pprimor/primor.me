      <p className='mb-3'>
        As a <span className="font-bold">computer science graduate</span> with a strong passion for problem solving, I have always striven to apply critical thinking and a touch of creativity to my work.
        I have <span className="underline">1 year of experience</span> working full time as a software engineer, and I am currently a Junior Software Engineer at <a href='https://pageproof.com' className='font-bold hover:underline'>PageProof</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always looking for <span className="italic">new challenges</span> and opportunities to learn and grow as a professional, and that is why I&rsquo;ve always had side projects and hobbies that I&rsquo;m passionate about. This website is one of them ðŸ˜„.
        When I&rsquo;m not working or studying new technologies, I like to spend my time <span className="font-medium">traveling</span>, meeting new people, and playing guitar.
